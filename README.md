# UFO's

# Overview
For this project, we are helping Dana create a webpage and dynamic tables to provide an in depth analysis of UFO sightings during the month of January. In addition to filtering our data by the date, we are asked to help her filter the table by city, state, county, and shape. We will be using Javascript and HTML to create this webpage to help Dana get information out to the world. 
## Results 
After finishing our HTML code, the website we designed for our client is pictured below. As you can see, we gave it a dark theme and a spacy design to match the theme of UFO's. There is a breif explanation to let our viewers know what they're in for.

As we scroll down the website, our data is then provided. To the left of the data, we have some filtering options to help the viewers get a more in-depth look at our data. They can see what cities, states, or countries have had a UFO sighting. Multiple filters can also be selected, to really pinpoint the data you are looking for.

## Summary 
Overall we created a webpage that looks clean and concise, and allows the users to filter through different types of data. One major drawback of our data is the validity of it. It is all just based off the encounters of individuals, with no video proof. If there was a column for how many people actually saw the event occur, that would add more legitimacy to the claims. Moving forward, adding more data would definately help Dana's claim, and it would spark more conversations about UFO's. As we accrue more data, we can also add more filters to the data as well.
